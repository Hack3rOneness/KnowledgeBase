### Description: 
this is a simple script to automatically extract the encrypted shellcode of iceid that are place in its PNG payload (steganography)

### Why?
1. the iceid variant that supported by this tools has same png payload structure that can be parse within the png file itself including the rc4 decryption (8 bytes), encrypted data, size of encrypted data
2. to minimize the time to reversing all over again the decryptor module of iceid (with the same decryption algo)
3. the png file is downloaded and place in a random folder in %appdata% using the username of the infected machine. so to decrypt it manually you need to know the random folder name that this malware created to successfully decrypt it.
